In Russia, strikes that resulted in child casualties occurred shortly after discussions between Trump and Putin were postponed. SpaceX has announced it has halted Starlink services to suspected scam operations in Myanmar. For the first time, a ranking has been established for the effects of antidepressants on physical health. Additionally, efforts are underway to verify images from a tragic bus crash in Uganda. Meanwhile, the WHO chief warned that the health crisis in Gaza will have long-lasting repercussions. The UN's highest court stated that Israel must permit UN aid into Gaza. Lastly, the complex dynamics between Trump and geopolitical issues in Gaza and Ukraine are also under examination.\n"
