      "In recent news, King Charles has made history as the first head of the Church of England to pray publicly alongside Pope Francis. Meanwhile, the Myanmar army is advancing in territorial control, aided by air strikes and support from China. In New Zealand, strong winds have left tens of thousands without power due to severe weather conditions. Delhi is grappling with toxic air pollution again, highlighting ongoing challenges in combating this issue. In Australia, a British man tragically drowned after his surfboard broke during wild weather. Additionally, former President Trump criticized his talks with Putin as unproductive while announcing new sanctions. In Australia, a person of interest has been identified in the case of a British girl's disappearance, and discussions continue regarding the socio-political engagement of young Indians, with questions about why they are not more active in protests.\n"
